## Javascript Apis

Website on which I call two Apis in Javascript (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php and https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) in order to give people the desire to cook by proposing them ideas. There will be a sort button for each Api as well as a random button to find an idea and a button to search for a particular dish/cocktail.
